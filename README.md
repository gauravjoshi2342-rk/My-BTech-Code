This repository contains my foundational coding work and projects as a 2nd Year CSE student.
## What's inside:

1.  *Python Projects:* Code for small applications like the Student Management System and Calculator App.
2.  *DSA Practice:* Solutions to core Data Structure and Algorithm problems (in Python).
